# McReminder
Discord bot written in python and [disco](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco/). MC Listens to messages until certain patterns are met, triggering an answer. The patterns and the type of answer to craft are completely configurable using a single JSON file. Supports embeds and attachments, too.  
Developed for the Discord channel of [gameloop.it](https://gameloop.it/), the Italian gamedev community.
